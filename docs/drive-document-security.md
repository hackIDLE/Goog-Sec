# Drive and Document Security in Google Workspace

This guide provides comprehensive strategies for securing Google Drive and documents in Google Workspace environments, with a focus on data protection, sharing controls, and external collaboration security.

## Understanding Google Drive Security Architecture

Google Drive security encompasses multiple layers of protection:

- **Access controls**: User and group permissions for files and folders
- **Sharing settings**: Controls for internal and external sharing
- **Data classification**: Identification and protection of sensitive content
- **DLP controls**: Prevention of unauthorized data exposure
- **Collaboration management**: Secure workflows for document collaboration
- **Retention and governance**: Lifecycle management for documents

## Securing Google Drive at the Organizational Level

### Core Drive Security Settings

Configure these essential settings in the Google Admin Console:

#### Sharing Controls

- **External sharing restrictions**: `Security > Sharing settings > Sharing options`
  - Recommended: "Only allow sharing with trusted domains" for most organizations
  - High-security: "Do not allow users to share files outside your organization"
  - Configure trusted domains based on business partnerships
  
- **Link sharing defaults**: `Security > Sharing settings > Link sharing defaults`
  - Recommended: "Off by default - only specific people can access"
  - Consider "Internal by default - anyone in your organization with the link can access"
  
- **File sharing permissions**: `Security > Sharing settings > File sharing permissions`
  - Restrict "Anyone with the link" options where possible
  - Consider disabling "Viewers and commenters can see the option to download, print, and copy"

#### Access Management

- **Access checks**: `Security > Access checks`
  - Enable "Drive and Docs: Warn when files are shared with external recipients"
  - Enable "Drive and Docs: Warn when files are shared outside your organization using a link"
  
- **Information rights management**: `Security > Information rights management`
  - Enable "Disable downloading, printing, and copying of files"
  - Create policies based on document sensitivity

#### Data Loss Prevention

- **DLP rules**: `Security > Data Loss Prevention`
  - Create rules to detect sensitive content like PII, financial data, confidential projects
  - Configure automated actions such as:
    - Warning users when sharing sensitive content
    - Blocking external sharing of sensitive documents
    - Applying classification labels to sensitive content
    - Restricting document copying and downloading

### Shared Drive Security

Shared Drives (formerly Team Drives) require specific security controls:

- **Shared Drive creation controls**: `Drive and Docs > Shared drive creation`
  - Consider limiting Shared Drive creation to specific users or groups
  - Implement naming conventions for Shared Drives with enforced prefixes

- **Shared Drive membership settings**: `Drive and Docs > Shared drive settings`
  - Configure "Who can add members to shared drives"
  - Set appropriate defaults for content manager assignments
  - Consider restricting external member addition to specific user groups

- **Content manager restrictions**: `Drive and Docs > Shared drive settings`
  - Configure who can manage members and change settings
  - Limit content manager role to appropriate personnel
  - Consider disabling "Shared drive members can make content visible to people outside your organization"

### Drive Audit Logging and Monitoring

Implement comprehensive audit capabilities:

- **Enable detailed Drive audit logs**: `Admin console > Reports > Audit > Drive`
  - Ensure logging for all relevant Drive events
  - Configure log retention appropriate for your compliance requirements

- **Set up alerts for sensitive activities**: `Admin console > Rules > Create rule`
  - Alert on bulk download or sharing operations
  - Monitor external sharing of sensitive content
  - Track unusual access patterns to critical documents

- **Export logs to security tools**: `Admin console > Reports > Audit > Export data`
  - Configure log export to SIEM systems
  - Implement automated monitoring for security events
  - Create custom dashboards for Drive security metrics

## File-Level Security Controls

### Document Classification Framework

Implement a standardized approach to document classification:

- **Classification levels**:
  - Public: Information approved for public release
  - Internal: General business information
  - Confidential: Sensitive information requiring protection
  - Restricted: Highly sensitive information with strict access

- **Classification implementation**:
  - Visual labels in document headers/footers
  - Naming conventions incorporating classification
  - Label-based access controls and DLP rules
  - Classification-based sharing restrictions

- **Classification governance**:
  - Regular classification reviews
  - Automated scanning for misclassified documents
  - User training on classification requirements
  - Auditing and reporting on classification compliance

### Document Access Controls

Implement granular access management:

- **Permission levels**:
  - Viewer: Can view but not edit or share
  - Commenter: Can comment but not edit content
  - Editor: Can edit and comment
  - Owner: Full control including deletion and permission management

- **Access review procedures**:
  - Quarterly reviews of sensitive document access
  - Workflows for access removal when no longer needed
  - Automated notifications for unusual access patterns
  - Regular validation of external collaborator access

- **Time-bound access**:
  - Implement access expiration for external collaborators
  - Configure automatic access removal for temporary projects
  - Regular review of long-standing access grants
  - Automated expiration for highly sensitive documents

### Document Sharing Best Practices

Establish clear guidelines for secure document sharing:

- **Internal sharing guidelines**:
  - Share with specific individuals rather than with "Anyone in organization"
  - Use groups for departmental or project-based access
  - Implement "Need to know" principle for sensitive information
  - Regular review and cleanup of document sharing

- **External sharing controls**:
  - Require explicit approval for external sharing of sensitive documents
  - Configure expiration dates for external access
  - Disable downloading for externally shared sensitive content
  - User account verification for external recipients

- **Secure link sharing**:
  - Avoid "Anyone with the link" for sensitive information
  - Implement password protection for shared links when available
  - Set appropriate expiration for shared links
  - Regular audit of active shared links

## Securing External Collaboration

### Vendor and Partner Access Management

Create a structured approach to external collaboration:

- **Partner domain verification**:
  - Verify partner domains before enabling trusted sharing
  - Document verification process for new partner domains
  - Regular review of trusted domain list
  - Establish security requirements for trusted partners

- **External collaboration workspace**:
  - Create dedicated Shared Drives for external collaboration
  - Implement strict access controls for external workspaces
  - Regular review of external workspace membership
