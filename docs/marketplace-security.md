# Google Workspace Marketplace Security

This guide provides security professionals and MSPs with comprehensive strategies for securing Google Workspace Marketplace applications, focusing on the unique challenges of managing third-party application security in multi-tenant environments.

## Understanding the Marketplace Security Landscape

### Marketplace Application Architecture

Google Workspace Marketplace applications can integrate with Google services in multiple ways, each with distinct security implications:

1. **OAuth-Based Integration**
   - Applications request specific OAuth scopes
   - Access persists through user-approved tokens
   - Can operate with user's permissions across Google services

2. **Add-on Integrations**
   - Context-specific extensions for Gmail, Drive, etc.
   - Run within specific Google applications
   - May have deep integration with content and data

3. **Chrome Extensions**
   - Browser-based functionality
   - Can interact with Google Workspace in the browser context
   - May have persistent access to user sessions

4. **Apps Script Integrations**
   - Custom code running in Google's infrastructure
   - Deep integration with Google services
   - Can create automations and workflows

### Critical Security Considerations

When managing Marketplace applications, several critical security factors must be addressed:

1. **Existing Installation Challenge**
   - **Key issue**: Allowlisting doesn't remove previously installed applications
   - Applications installed before restrictions may retain access
   - User-level installations may exist across organizational units

2. **Organizational Unit Limitations**
   - Applications can be enabled/disabled at OU level
   - User movement between OUs impacts application access
   - Some administrative applications bypass OU controls

3. **Permission Persistence**
   - OAuth tokens may persist despite policy changes
   - Application access can survive user password changes
   - Revoking access requires explicit token revocation

4. **Installation Scope Variations**
   - Some apps can only be installed by administrators
   - Others allow user-initiated installation
   - Admin-installed apps may have different permission models

## Comprehensive Marketplace Security Strategy

### 1. Application Inventory and Audit

First, establish complete visibility into your current Marketplace application landscape:

**Inventory Current Installations:**
```python
# Python script example using Google Admin SDK
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from oauth2client.service_account import ServiceAccountCredentials

def get_installed_applications(admin_sdk_service):
    """Retrieve all installed Marketplace applications across the organization"""
    # Get all Chrome apps and extensions
    chrome_apps = admin_sdk_service.chromeosdevices().list(customerId='my_customer').execute()
    
    # Get OAuth application grants
    tokens = admin_sdk_service.tokens().list(customerId='my_customer').execute()
    
    # Get Apps Script projects
    # Note: Requires Apps Script API enablement
    # [Implementation details]
    
    return {
        'chrome_apps': chrome_apps,
        'oauth_tokens': tokens,
        'apps_scripts': apps_scripts
    }

# Authentication setup
credentials = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name(
    'service-account.json',
    ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.device.chromeos',
     'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user']
)
credentials = credentials.create_delegated('admin@domain.com')
service = build('admin', 'directory_v1', credentials=credentials)

# Get inventory
app_inventory = get_installed_applications(service)
```

**Audit Techniques:**
1. Compare installed applications against current allowlist
2. Identify previously installed applications that would now be restricted
3. Document application permissions and access scopes
4. Map user-to-application relationships

### 2. Comprehensive Cleanup Process

Address existing installations that don't meet current security requirements:

**Admin-Level Cleanup:**
```
Admin Console > Apps > Marketplace Apps > App Management
- Filter for "User-installed apps"
- Select non-compliant applications
- Click "Revoke" to remove access organization-wide
```

**Important**: This will revoke OAuth access tokens for selected applications across all users, but requires careful planning to avoid disruption.

**Scripted Token Revocation:**
```python
# Python script to revoke specific application tokens
def revoke_application_tokens(admin_sdk_service, client_id):
    """Revoke all tokens for a specific application client ID"""
    users = admin_sdk_service.users().list(customer='my_customer').execute()
    
    for user in users.get('users', []):
        user_email = user['primaryEmail']
        try:
            # List tokens for user
            tokens = admin_sdk_service.tokens().list(userKey=user_email).execute()
            
            # Find and revoke tokens for target application
            for token in tokens.get('items', []):
                if token.get('clientId') == client_id:
                    admin_sdk_service.tokens().delete(
                        userKey=user_email,
                        clientId=client_id
                    ).execute()
                    print(f"Revoked token for {user_email}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error processing {user_email}: {str(e)}")
```

**Chrome Extension Cleanup:**
```
Admin Console > Devices > Chrome > Apps & Extensions
- Locate non-compliant extensions
- Block installation and force removal
```

**Apps Script Project Audit:**
```
Admin Console > Security > API Controls > Apps Script
- Review and configure Apps Script project settings
- Disable unauthorized Apps Script execution
```

### 3. Implementing Proper Application Controls

Configure comprehensive controls for Marketplace applications:

**OAuth Application Allowlisting:**
```
Admin Console > Security > API Controls > Domain-wide OAuth API Access Control
- Set to "Only allow user access to specific third-party applications"
- Configure "Google Workspace Marketplace Apps control"
```

**Important Considerations:**
1. Allowlisting is forward-looking and doesn't affect existing installations
2. Test impact on critical applications before enforcement
3. Document exceptions and justifications

**Application Installation Policy:**
```
Admin Console > Apps > Marketplace Apps > Settings
- Choose appropriate installation restrictions:
  - "Only allow installation of selected applications"
  - "Block installation of specific applications"
- Apply settings to appropriate OUs
```

**Chrome Application Management:**
```
Admin Console > Devices > Chrome > Apps & Extensions
- Configure force-installed applications
- Block unauthorized extensions
- Set installation permissions by OU
```

### 4. Organizational Unit Application Strategy

Develop a structured approach for application management across OUs:

**OU-Based Application Profiles:**
1. Define application requirements by user function
2. Create OU structure that supports differentiated application access
3. Document required applications for each functional group

**OU Transition Procedures:**
1. Develop process for handling application access during OU moves
2. Create verification procedures for access changes
3. Implement monitoring for unexpected application behaviors after moves

**Handling Administrator-Only Applications:**
1. Identify applications that can only be installed by administrators
2. Create approval workflow for admin-level application requests
3. Implement enhanced monitoring for privileged applications

## Advanced Marketplace Security Techniques

### Continuous Application Monitoring

Implement ongoing monitoring to detect application security risks:

**OAuth Token Activity Monitoring:**
```sql
-- Example monitoring query for suspicious application activity
SELECT user_email, application_name, client_id, scope_list, 
       request_time, ip_address, user_agent
FROM token_audit_logs
WHERE application_name NOT IN (SELECT app_name FROM approved_applications)
  AND (
    scope_list LIKE '%gmail%' OR
    scope_list LIKE '%drive%' OR
    scope_list LIKE '%admin%'
  )
ORDER BY request_time DESC
```

**Application Behavior Analysis:**
1. Establish baseline application activity patterns
2. Monitor for anomalous API call volumes or patterns
3. Track application resource access changes
4. Implement alerts for suspicious authorization requests
