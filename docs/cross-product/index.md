## üîç About Cross-Product Security

Organizations that use multiple Google products need security strategies that work across these environments. Cross-product security focuses on:

### Key Security Considerations

- **Identity Federation**: Managing identities consistently across services
- **Security Center Integration**: Connecting security monitoring across environments
- **Threat Intelligence Sharing**: Leveraging threat data across products
- **Unified Security Policies**: Implementing consistent controls
- **Compliance Management**: Meeting regulatory requirements across all Google services
- **Security Operations**: Building SOC capabilities for multi-product environments
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Implementing zero trust across Google products
- **Data Governance**: Managing data protection across environments

## Getting Started

This section is organized into several key cross-product security areas:

1. **Identity Federation**: Managing identities across Google products
2. **Zero Trust Architecture**: Implementing consistent zero trust principles
3. **Security Operations**: Building SOC capabilities for multiple Google services
4. **Data Protection**: Consistent data security controls
5. **Threat Detection**: Cross-environment threat monitoring
6. **Compliance Management**: Unified compliance approach
7. **Security Architecture**: Reference architectures for multi-product environments
8. **Security Automation**: Automating security across Google products
