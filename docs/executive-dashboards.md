# Google Workspace Security Dashboards and Executive Reporting

This guide provides comprehensive frameworks, templates, and implementation strategies for creating effective security dashboards and executive-level reporting for Google Workspace environments.

## Executive Security Dashboard Framework

### Dashboard Design Principles

Creating effective security dashboards for executive consumption requires balancing detail with clarity:

1. **Audience-Centered Design**
   - Focus on business impact and risk
   - Limit technical jargon and details
   - Align metrics with organizational priorities
   - Present actionable insights

2. **Visual Clarity**
   - Use consistent visualization methods
   - Implement intuitive color schemes (green/yellow/red)
   - Provide clear trend indicators
   - Balance data density with readability

3. **Context and Benchmarking**
   - Include relevant industry benchmarks
   - Provide historical trend context
   - Show comparison to security targets
   - Include peer organization comparison when available

4. **Actionable Insights**
   - Highlight specific recommended actions
   - Connect metrics to business outcomes
   - Provide priority guidance
   - Include improvement trajectories

## Executive Dashboard Templates

### 1. Google Workspace Security Posture Dashboard

This dashboard provides a high-level view of overall security posture and compliance status.

#### Key Components

1. **Overall Security Score**
   - Composite rating (0-100) based on security controls
   - Trend indicator (improving/declining)
   - Comparison to industry benchmark
   - Risk-level indicator (Low/Medium/High/Critical)

   ![Security Score Component](https://example.com/security-score.png)
   ```
   Implementation:
   - Aggregate scores from security controls across services
   - Weight components based on risk impact
   - Calculate trend based on 90-day historical data
   - Update weekly for consistency
   ```

2. **Service Security Compliance**
   - Matrix showing security compliance by service
   - Color-coded status indicators
   - Critical service highlighting
   - Non-compliant control count

   **Service Compliance Matrix Example:**

   | Service | Security Score | Critical Controls | Trend | Status |
   |---------|----------------|-------------------|-------|--------|
   | Gmail   | 92/100         | 100% (15/15)      | ↑ 3%  | ✅     |
   | Drive   | 78/100         | 93% (14/15)       | ↓ 2%  | ⚠️     |
   | Identity| 95/100         | 100% (12/12)      | ↑ 5%  | ✅     |
   | Meet    | 85/100         | 100% (10/10)      | ↔ 0%  | ✅     |
   | Groups  | 72/100         | 89% (8/9)         | ↑ 12% | ⚠️     |

       # Define the scopes required for API access
       SCOPES = [
           'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.reports.audit.readonly',
           'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.reports.usage.readonly',

       # Service account credentials from JSON key file
       credentials = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name(
           'service-account-key.json', SCOPES)
       
       # Delegate to an admin user
       delegated_credentials = credentials.create_delegated('admin@yourdomain.com')
       
       # Build services
       services = {
           'reports': build('admin', 'reports_v1', credentials=delegated_credentials),
           'directory': build('admin', 'directory_v1', credentials=delegated_credentials),
