# Note: This is a placeholder file

This is just a text file with a .png extension. You'll need to:

1. Open create_cards.html in a browser
2. Take a screenshot of the rendered card
3. Save it as default.png in this directory

The actual image should be 1200x630 pixels and showcase your Google Security Suite brand.
