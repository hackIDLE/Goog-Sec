# Compute Security in Google Cloud Platform

!!! note "Under Construction"
    This page is under construction. Please check back later for comprehensive guidance on securing compute resources in Google Cloud Platform.

## Overview

This section will provide detailed guidance on securing various compute resources in Google Cloud Platform including:

- Virtual Machines (Compute Engine)
- Containers (Cloud Run, GKE)
- Serverless (Cloud Functions)
- App Engine applications

## Coming Soon

- Hardening GCE instances
- Securing container workloads
- Securing serverless functions
- Identity-based access controls for compute resources
- Compute resource monitoring and logging best practices
- Vulnerability management for compute environments
