## üîç About GCP Security

Google Cloud Platform security requires a comprehensive approach that addresses infrastructure security, application security, data protection, identity management, and compliance.

### Key Security Considerations

- **Shared Responsibility Model**: Understanding what Google secures and what you are responsible for
- **Identity & Access Management**: Implementing least privilege and secure IAM practices
- **Network Security**: Designing secure VPC architectures and implementing proper network controls
- **Data Protection**: Encrypting data at rest and in transit, managing secrets securely
- **Compute Security**: Hardening VMs, containers, and serverless functions
- **Monitoring & Detection**: Implementing robust logging, monitoring, and alerting
- **Incident Response**: Planning for and practicing response to cloud security incidents
- **Compliance**: Meeting regulatory requirements in cloud environments

## Getting Started

This section is organized into several key areas of GCP security:

1. **Identity & Access Management**: Managing identities, roles, permissions, and authentication
2. **Network Security**: Securing VPC networks, firewalls, and connectivity
3. **Compute Security**: Securing VMs, containers, Kubernetes, and serverless
4. **Storage & Database Security**: Protecting data in various storage services
5. **Logging & Monitoring**: Implementing effective security monitoring
6. **Security Command Center**: Utilizing GCP's security management platform
7. **DevSecOps**: Integrating security into CI/CD pipelines
8. **Compliance & Governance**: Maintaining regulatory compliance in GCP
