# Network Security in Google Cloud Platform

Securing network infrastructure is a critical component of cloud security. This guide covers network security architecture, controls, and best practices for Google Cloud Platform environments.

## Core Network Security Concepts

### VPC Architecture

Google Cloud VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) provides network segmentation and isolation:

- **VPC Networks**: Software-defined networks that provide global connectivity
- **Subnets**: Regional IP address ranges for resources
- **Peering**: Connecting VPC networks with each other
- **Shared VPC**: Centrally managed network shared across projects

### Defense in Depth

Implement multiple network security controls:

- **Perimeter Security**: VPC Service Controls and organization policy constraints
- **Network Security**: Firewalls, security groups, and Network Intelligence Center
- **Resource Security**: Identity-aware access controls and service-specific protections

## Security Best Practices

### Secure VPC Design

- Implement a hub-and-spoke or similar network topology
- Segment networks based on security requirements
- Use private Google Access for services
- Implement VPC Service Controls for sensitive data

### Firewall Configuration

- Implement default-deny policies
- Allow only necessary traffic
- Use hierarchical firewall policies for organization-wide rules
- Implement tags and service accounts for dynamic firewall rules

### Connectivity Security

- Use Cloud VPN or Cloud Interconnect with encryption
- Implement Private Service Connect for Google APIs and services
- Use Cloud NAT for controlled egress
- Implement BeyondCorp Enterprise for zero-trust access

### Traffic Inspection

- Deploy Cloud IDS for network threat detection
- Implement Cloud Armor for web application and DDoS protection
- Use Network Intelligence Center for visibility into traffic patterns
- Configure VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring

## Implementation Guide

### Secure Network Architecture

1. **Design network segmentation**
   - Create separate VPC networks for production, development, and testing
   - Implement security boundaries between high and low-sensitivity data

2. **Configure secure connectivity**
   - Set up private connectivity to Google services
   - Implement secure hybrid connectivity for on-premises resources

3. **Implement defense in depth**
   - Deploy multiple security controls at different layers
   - Configure monitoring and threat detection

### Security Hardening Steps

```bash
# Example: Create a VPC with private Google access
gcloud compute networks create secure-network --subnet-mode=custom

# Create subnet with private Google access enabled
gcloud compute networks subnets create secure-subnet \
    --network=secure-network \
    --region=us-central1 \
    --range=10.0.0.0/24 \
    --enable-private-ip-google-access

# Example: Create a firewall rule allowing only necessary traffic
gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-internal \
    --direction=INGRESS \
    --priority=1000 \
    --network=secure-network \
    --action=ALLOW \
    --rules=tcp:22,tcp:3389,icmp \
    --source-ranges=10.0.0.0/24

# Enable VPC Flow Logs
gcloud compute networks subnets update secure-subnet \
    --region=us-central1 \
    --enable-flow-logs
```

## Network Security Controls

### Firewall Rules

- **Hierarchical Firewalls**: Organization and folder-level rules
- **VPC Firewalls**: Network-level rules
- **Firewall Insights**: Analyzing rule usage and recommending optimizations

### Cloud Armor

- Web Application Firewall (WAF) capabilities
- DDoS protection
- Edge security for applications
- Preconfigured rules for common attacks (OWASP Top 10)

### VPC Service Controls

- Creating security perimeters around resources
- Preventing data exfiltration
- Implementing context-aware access
- Securing APIs and services

### Cloud IDS

- Network-based threat detection
- Intrusion detection capabilities
- Integration with security operations

## Common Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Lateral movement | Implement network segmentation and microsegmentation |
| Data exfiltration | Deploy VPC Service Controls and egress control |
| Unauthorized access | Implement BeyondCorp and IAP for zero-trust access |
| External attacks | Configure Cloud Armor and DDoS protection |
| Misconfigurations | Use Security Command Center and regular auditing |

## Advanced Topics

### Zero Trust Network Security

- Implement BeyondCorp Enterprise
- Deploy Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) for application access
- Move beyond network-based security to identity-based controls

### Network Security for Kubernetes

- Configure GKE private clusters
- Implement network policies
- Use Binary Authorization for workload security
- Deploy Service Mesh for fine-grained traffic control

### Multi-Cloud Network Security

- Consistent security controls across environments
- Centralized monitoring and management
- Secure connectivity between cloud providers
